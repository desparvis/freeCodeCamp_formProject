# Form Designing
Here is what I did in this project:
0. I learnt how to use CSS properly.
1. I learnt how to design forms properly, but it's not responsive.
2. I used freeCodeCamp to learn all this.
I have finished the first project for getting my freeCodeCamp certificate. This is 1/5 certificates that I have to get.
If you are reading this, never give up. You will get better if you keep trying. Thanks for opening this README.md.
